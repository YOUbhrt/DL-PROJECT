# Skin Lesions Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Network
Skin cancer is a major public health problem with over 123,000 newly diagnosed cases worldwide in every year. Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer, responsible for over 9000 deaths in the United States each year. Thus, reliable automatic melanoma screening systems would provide a great help for clinicians to detect the malignant skin lesions as early as possible. In the last five years, the efficiency of deep learning-based methods increased dramatically and their performances seem to outperform conventional image processing methods in classification tasks.
